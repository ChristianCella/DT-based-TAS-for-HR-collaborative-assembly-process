"""
This code is the Python side of the communication between Python and C#.
It works according to the scheme proposed on OneNote in the section "Tecnomatix - Architecture of the TCP socket communication".
First, the C# is launched (Fn + F5) and then this Python code is executed.
a) from C#, the python code receives the time and the RULA score of the simulation.
b) on the basis of these values, the python code performs the Bayesian Optimization and sends the command to C#.
Of course, for this example, the command is simply the sum of 1 to each element of the array containing the time and the RULA score
(additional_var is added in order to increase the number of elements to be packed and sent to C#).
c) from C#, the python code receives the variable 'trigger_end' that is used to stop the communication when the maximum 
number of simulations is reached.
